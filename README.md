# Word Sense Disambiguation Challenge
Word sense disambiguation NLP challenge

The challenge problem:
 
Attached you will find a 70006-word excerpt from the novel “A Tale of Two Cities” by Charles Dickens (CharlesDickensTwoTales_orig.txt).
You will also find an obfuscated version where each instance of the words “a” and “the” have been replaced by the words “a” or “the” (CharlesDickensTwoTales_obfuscated.txt).
 
Your task is to resolve the “a/the” ambiguity in the latter version as best as possible via a computer program. Note this program should not access any part of the novel “A Tale of Two Cities” to accomplish this; i.e. it cannot “train on” or “memorize” this particular novel. You are otherwise free to use whatever approach you see fit.
 
In particular please provide:
· A working program which takes “CharlesDickensTwoTales_obfuscated.txt“ as input and generates an output file where each instance of the word “a” and “the”  is disambiguated. 
· The output of this program.
· An assessment of the output of the program (i.e. the fraction of “a/the” instances correctly resolved).
· A description of how you approached the problem, how your program works and how much time you spent.
